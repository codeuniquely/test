 # Test Project
 This is a test project.

 It simply defines and set of test for a single array splitting function.

 ```
Given an array of length >= 0, and a positive integer N, return the contents of the array divided into N
equally sized arrays.

Where the size of the original array cannot be divided equally by N, the final part should have a length equal
to the remainder.

groupArrayElements([ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 ], 3 );
 ```
